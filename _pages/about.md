I’m a finance graduate transitioning into computer science and AI, focused on building research-grade systems in multimodal learning, generative video, and long-horizon reasoning. My work blends applied ML engineering with market intelligence research, especially prediction markets and high-frequency statistical arbitrage.

I’m currently building a portfolio of open-source projects and research-style writeups aimed at MS/PhD-level readiness and research engineer roles.

**Research interests**

* Long-horizon video understanding + memory-based reasoning
* Multimodal generative systems (audio → visuals, video generation, world modeling)
* Agentic AI systems for decision-making and planning
* Prediction markets + microstructure research + quantitative trading strategies

## Featured Projects

**Gameplay Vision LLM**
Long-horizon gameplay video understanding with segmentation, retrieval, and reasoning loops for agent-like interpretation of complex scenes.

**Visual Internal Reasoning**
Experiments in structured latent representations for causal reasoning and visual memory, inspired by research directions in world models.

**High-Frequency Statistical Arbitrage on Prediction Markets**
Research pipeline for modeling short-horizon price movement, order-book imbalance impact, and strategy design for event-based markets.

**CineMatch (Product Concept + UI/Design)**
A movie-matching and theater discovery app concept with AI-powered matching and social discovery features

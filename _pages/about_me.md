I’m Chase J. Metoyer, a finance graduate building toward advanced work in computer science and artificial intelligence. I’m especially interested in multimodal systems that can perceive and reason over time, including long-horizon video understanding, generative media, and agentic decision-making.

My longer-term goal is to contribute to research and engineering efforts that push beyond short-context chat models toward systems that can plan, remember, and act in complex environments. I’m also deeply interested in the intersection of AI and markets, particularly prediction markets and quantitative trading research.

I build AI systems that combine perception, memory, and decision-making over time, with a focus on multimodal reasoning and generative media. I’m also interested in quantitative market systems, especially prediction markets, and how microstructure dynamics shape short-horizon forecasting and trading strategies.
